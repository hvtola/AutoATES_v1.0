# AutoATES_v1.0

AutoATES version 1 is described in detail in Larsen et al. (2020; 2018). The algorithm account for slope angle, potential release areas (PRA), and runout (TauDEM). The primary limitations is that the algorithm do not account for vegetation data, overhead exposure and is heavily dependent on ESRI ArcGIS software (proprietary). The algorithm also uses many different formats, using a lot of computer power to convert data.
